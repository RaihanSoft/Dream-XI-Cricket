## 📝 Description
This project allows users to simulate a player selection scenario where they can view available players, purchase players using in-app coins, and manage their selected players. Designed to provide a clean, interactive interface, users can add players, receive notifications, and experience a smooth selection flow with real-time updates.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the application’s dynamic, interactive components.
- **React-Toastify**: Enhanced user notifications for alerts and feedback.
- **CSS/TailWindCSS**: For customized, responsive styling that matches the Figma design.
- **JSON**: Stores the player data, including attributes like name, role, country, and more.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Player Selection**  
   Toggle between *Available* and *Selected* views to browse and manage players. Choose players based on your coin balance, and enjoy the smooth flow and animations throughout.

2. **Real-Time Coin Management**  
   - The navbar displays your current coin balance, which updates every time you earn or spend coins.
   - Coins increase with each button click on the banner, letting you add players to your selection.

3. **Dynamic Validations and Notifications**  
   - Avoid duplicate selections with in-app validations.
   - Set a selection limit of six players.
   - User alerts for any errors or limits, shown via **React-Toastify** for an enhanced experience.
